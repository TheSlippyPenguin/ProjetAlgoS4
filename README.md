# Projet Algo S4 :
Video Color Analysis : a Python library implementing various computer vision methods to analyse the color profile of a video over time.

# Short-term todo list
-  CPU usage (low priority)
-  resize to 900x600 (at least, even think about fullscreen app)
-  display output image properly
-  hide preview images (load w PIL.ImageTk ins. of cv2.imread)
-  rangeslider labels should be time instead of frame number
-  setting for output image height
-  quality slider is useless except for cluster mode
-  investigate what the fuck filetypes are in filedialog.askdirectory()
